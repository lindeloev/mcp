There are a lot of change point packages out there already, so why `mcp`? Here are my (probably biased) thoughts about this. I compiled some tables, summarising change point packages ([.xlsx file here](https://github.com/lindeloev/mcp/raw/master/man/figures/packages_tables.xlsx)). I will demonstrate each of these packages in an applied example below to discuss their merits and shortcomings. 

I think `segmented`, and `EnvCpt` are good if the data fits what they can model, and `mcp` is a more capable and general-purpose package at the cost of speed. You can see the immediate roadmap for `mcp` at the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/lindeloev/mcp/issues).


## Modeling options
How much flexibility does the package allow for modeling the system, you're studying? A clear difference here is between packages that allow you to *specify* the number of change points, and packages which infer the number of change points *automatically* (using some criteria), captured in the `N` column below.

<br /><br />


## Inference 
What can you learn, once the model has fitted? While all packages return the estimated Change Points, few return an index of uncertainty around that estimate (`CP CI`: confidence intervals, highest-density intervals, or posterior densities). Sometimes, it may not even be the change point that is of interest, but rather the parameters of the segments in between (`params`, `params CI`). Finally, you may want to compare models, e.g., testing whether a change point is present or not, or testing the nature of the segments between change points (`hypothesis tests`).

Note that `EnvCpt` returns one log-likelihood per model, which one then could do testing on. `segmented` returns AIC and deviance, so ditto here. However, this is something you would have to do yourself. `mcp` explicitly supports and recommends workflows for detailed model comparisons.

<br /><br />


## Other conveniences
This is a list of other functions, which I find useful on other statistics packages, including simulating data, getting fitted and predicted values given the model, and an assessment of speed. The option to include prior knowledge could be important in some situations.

# Unique features of mcp

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# So that calls to mcp stuff does not elicit errors
library(mcp)
```

 * Manually specify the segment structure. Other packages allow for specifying segment structure, but it has to be shared for all segments. Read more about [the formula syntax](../articles/formulas.html) in `mcp`.
 * Posterior distribution for each change point. This matters since they rarely conform to known distributions so confidence intervals can be misleading.
 * *varying change points*: To my knowledge, no other package implements varying change points, i.e., allowing by-group differences in change points while sharing all other parameters. Read more about [varying change points](../articles/varying.html) in `mcp`.
 * *Sharing and fixing parameters* to values and other parameters as discussed under [priors in mcp](../articles/priors.html).
 * *Per-segment regression on variance and autocorrelation* via the `sigma()` ([read more here](../articles/variance.html)) and `ar()` ([read more here](../articles/arma.html)) terms, also allowing for more advanced change points involving, e.g., a change in autocorrelation strength.
 * *Explicit priors*: `bcp` is the only other Bayesian change point package I know of. It contains a few high-level prior parameters, but not for specific parameters such as *where* change points are expected to occur etc. Read more about [priors in mcp](../articles/priors.html) for more.
 * *Prior and posterior predictive checks*. In general, most other packages have limited or no model checking functionality. The default `plot.mcpfit` is inherently a visual predictive check and can be applied to priors (`mcp(..., sample = "prior")` and posteriors. Of course inspecting Gelman-Rubin statistics and effective sample sizes in `summary.mcpfit`, as well as trace plots (`plot_pars(fit, type = "trace")`), also go a long way.
 * Flexible hypothesis testing using `loo` and `hypothesis`, including testing the existence of a change point. Most other packages stop at estimation, though some provide p-values. Read more about [hypothesis testing and model comparison](../articles/comparison.html) using `mcp`.


# Recommendation

Let me go all-out on my ego-serving bias and say that `mcp` is the best package *unless:*

 * *You have a lot of data and limited time*: While `mcp` is reasonably fast for typical problems, MCMC sampling is slower than analytical and specialized solutions. For datasets > 20.000 points and a complicated model, it may take `mcp` hours (but not days) to fit. See [tips and tricks](../articles/tips.html) how to speed up `mcp`. Briefly, run in parallel and lower the number of iterations: (`mcp(..., cores = 4, iter = 1000, adapt = 400`).
 * *You want to automatically detect a large number of change points*: Most packages does automatic change point detection. This is not a space that `mcp` tries to fill. But beware that many of the automatic procedures did not capture a change point in the worked examples below. If recommend `segmented` for the models it "understands" followed by `EnvCpt` and perhaps `bcp`.
 * *Multivariate*: `mcp` only does univariate regression, both for $y$ and $x$. This will be implemented if there is a popular request for it. Don't hesitate to raise an issue on GitHub. For now, `bcp` seems like the best option to me.



# A simple dataset to compare packages
As a simple example, we simulate some intercept-only data with change points at 30 (from mean=2 to mean=0) and 70 (to mean=1) and a residual of 1 SD.

```{r}
# Simulate
set.seed(42)  # I always use 42; no fiddling
df = data.frame(
  x = 1:100,
  y = c(rnorm(30, 2), rnorm(40, 0), rnorm(30, 1))
)

# Plot it
plot(df)
abline(v = c(30, 70), col="red")
```

# mcp
`mcp` needs no further introduction. We fit the three-plateaus model with default priors:.

```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(mcp)
model = list(y~1, 1~1, 1~1)  # three intercept-only segments
fit_mcp = mcp(model, data = df, par_x = "x")

summary(fit_mcp)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(fit_mcp)
```


The summary shows good parameter recovery, though the second change point is detected a bit early. This is understandable if you look at the data, and the true change point is still within the highest density interval. 

Plotting the posterior distributions of the change points reveal that they are not well represented by a Gaussian or other known distributions. Therefore, confidence intervals are likely to be meaningless for this problem.

```{r}
library(patchwork)
plot(fit_mcp) + plot_pars(fit_mcp, pars = c("cp_1", "cp_2"), type = "dens_overlay")
```

`mcp` takes around 6 seconds to fit this example, which is the slowest of all the packages considered here. You can bring that down to 2.5 seconds by running in parallel, using `mcp(..., cores = 3)` or for the full session using `options(mc.cores = 3)`.




# EnvCpt
`EnvCpt` can detect change points in mean and variance (not separately), slopes ("trends"), and AR(1)/AR(2), as well as conveniently fitting various models without change points. It automatically infers the number of change points. Unless otherwise instructed (through `models` argument), `EnvCpt` fits all models to the data, allowing you to pick one. It allows 

```{r, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library(EnvCpt)
fit_envcpt = envcpt(df$y)  # Fit all models at once
fit_envcpt$summary  # Show log-likelihoods
```

This can be used to maximize the log-likelihood. Of interest here is `meancpt`. The documentation says that it calls `changepoint::cpt.meanvar`, modeling a simultaneous change in mean and variance. Curiously, `changepoint::cpt.meanvar(df$y)` only finds one change point when called directly (see below), but the output matches `changepoint.np::cpt.np(df$y)@cpts`, so I suspect that this function is used instead. `EnvCpt`  has a nice plot of all the models:

```{r}
plot(fit_envcpt)
```

Digging into the `meancpt`, we get maximum-likelihood estimates of the change points and the parameters of each segment.
```{r}
fit_envcpt$meancpt@cpts
fit_envcpt$meancpt@param.est
```

I think the change point at `x = 100` should just be ignored. We see that it approximately identifies the change points, though without intervals.



# segmented
`segmented` seems to be the most popular package for change point analysis. It has a very shallow learning curve combined with great modeling flexibility. You simply specify your model in `lm`, `glm`, `Arima`, and also work for e.g. `coxph` (Cox proportional Hazard). Supply it to `segmented` which then segment your data along the x-axis and applies the linear model in each segment. The trick is identifying the locations where this split works the best. The positive consequence is that you get great modeling flexibility with GLM, AR(1) models, etc. 

The downside is that you can only have one *kind* of segments and (for some reason) *it ignores the intercepts on anything but the first segment*. Only (joined) slopes are supported in segment 2+. Unfortunately, this means that `segmented` fails for the present changing-intercept data. In my limited testing, it also ignores quadratic and other terms, so even though the design philosophy is excellent, you have to carefully double-check whether it actually models what you asked it to. 

`segmented` is otherwise well developed with prediction functions, (frequentist) intervals, plots, etc. so if you have large datasets with impermissible long run times in `mcp` and it matches what `segmented` can model, it is a good option.

Enough talk:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(segmented)
fit_lm = lm(y ~ 1 + x, data = df)  # intercept-only model
fit_segmented = segmented(fit_lm, seg.Z = ~x, npsi = 2)  # Two change points along x

summary(fit_segmented)
```

As expected, the change points are off (`psi1.x` and `psi2.x`). The default plot is sparse, but you can quickly add more info:


```{r}
plot(fit_segmented)
points(df)
lines.segmented(fit_segmented)
points.segmented(fit_segmented)
```

Because the fitted objects returned by `segmented` contains `aic`, `deviance`, etc. it is in principle possible to do model comparison. Here is a BIC-based Bayes Factor testing whether there is one or two change points in the data:

```{r}
fit_segmented_1 = segmented(fit_lm, seg.Z = ~x, npsi = 1)
BF = exp((BIC(fit_segmented) - BIC(fit_segmented_1))/2)  # From Wagenmakers (2007)
BF
```

We can do the same using `mcp`:
```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_1 = list(y~1, 1~1)
fit_mcp_1 = mcp(model_1, data = df, par_x = "x")
fit_mcp_1$loo = loo(fit_mcp_1)
fit_mcp$loo = loo(fit_mcp)
loo::loo_compare(fit_mcp$loo, fit_mcp_1$loo)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
loo::loo_compare(fit_mcp$loo, fit_mcp_1$loo)
```


While `segmented` prefers the one-change-point model, `mcp` prefers the (true) two-change-point model. Again, the models compared here are *very* different since `segmented` does inference on a slope-only model.



# strucchange::breakpoints
`strucchange::breakpoints()` is a lot like `segmented`. The difference is that (1) it is limited to gaussian residuals, and (2) it actually models intercepts, quadratic terms, etc. It scans through fits with 1, 2, 3,... N break points and determine where the optimal break points between this number of segments would lie. For each model it computes the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS; monotonically smaller with increasing N) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; has a minimum) for each N. It selects the model with the smallest BIC.

For an intercept-only model (`y ~ 1`) it correctly detects the two change points with estimates similar to `mcp`. As with most other packages, there are no intervals on the change points nor estimates of the parameters of the segments in between.

```{r}
library(strucchange)
fit_bp = breakpoints(y ~ 1, data = df, breaks = 2)
summary(fit_bp)
```

Reassuringly, for `y ~ 1 + x` it "recommends" the same single change point that `segmented` found for this model.





# cpm
`cpm` is an intercept-only (in mean and variance) package, so it cannot model slopes. It can detect single change points via `detectChangePoint` and multiple change points via `processStream`. `processStream` is an automatic change point detection, using a p-value threshold to determine if a candidate should be marked as a hit. Multiple ways of computing p-values (`cpmType`) are available. In my limited testing, they return similar change points, though not identical.

```{r}
library(cpm)
#fit_cpm = detectChangePoint(df$y, cpmType = "Student")  # a single change point
#fit_cpm = processStream(df$y, cpmType = "Mann-Whitney")  # Detects three
fit_cpm = processStream(df$y, cpmType = "Student")  # Multiple change points
fit_cpm$changePoints
```

It detects two change points, which is good. No intervals are returned and no plot functions are provided. The second change point is estimated a bit further away from the true value than `mcp`.







# changepoint and changepoint.np
`changepoint` is focused on intercept-only changes. It can estimate changes in means (`cpt.mean`), variance (`cpt.var`), or both (`cpt.meanvar`). It is semi-automatic in that you can set the number of change points using parameter `Q` and this defaults to five. It can recover ML estimates of the intercepts. It does not estimate uncertainty, nor model checking. It only takes a response variable, so the change point is the data *index*, not the point on an x-axis. Make sure that your data is ordered. In our case it is ordered and we have 1 data point at each `x`, so it is optimal for `changepoint`.

It detects the first change point, but not the second.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(changepoint)
fit_changepoint = cpt.mean(df$y)

# Return estimates
c(ints = param.est(fit_changepoint)$mean,
  cp = cpts(fit_changepoint))
```

Plot:
```{r}
plot(fit_changepoint)
```

The package `changepoint.np` extends `changepoint` by providing a non-parametric version. It is unclear which of the `changepoint` functions are extended, but it manages to find both change points to a good precision. As with many other packages, no intervals are provided. As mentioned earlier, I suspect that `EnvCpt` uses this function under the hood.

```{r}
changepoint.np::cpt.np(df$y)@cpts
```





# bcp
`bcp` is the only other Bayesian package in the game. It automatically detects change points and segment types, though you can use the parameter `d` to increase the prior probability of intercept-only models. It provides estimates of means and probability of change point *at each x-coordinate*. It has little additional functionality. The summary method conveys the same as the plot, so let's stick to the plot. 

We see that it vaguely captures the change point at `x = 30`, and has some smeared-out probability around `x = 60` (`mcp` detected a single change point at `x = 64` here). `bcp` has some "false alarms" at `x < 20`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(bcp)
fit_bcp = bcp(df$y, d = 1000)
plot(fit_bcp)
```


# ecp
`ecp` contains six functions to detect change points. It is clearly built for multivariate data, but can take univariate too. Of the six functions, I have not managed to get `e.agglo` working for `df`, but here I demonstrate the other five. The resulting information is sparse. It detects one of the two change points, but not both (with the exception of `e.divisive`, which returns four),

```{r}
df_ecp = as.matrix(df$y)
fit_ecp1 = ecp::e.cp3o(df_ecp, K = 2)  # maximum 2 change points
fit_ecp2 = ecp::e.cp3o_delta(df_ecp, K = 2)  # maximum 2 change points
fit_ecp3 = ecp::e.divisive(df_ecp, k = 2)  # 2 change points. Ignored???
fit_ecp4 = ecp::ks.cp3o(df_ecp, K = 2)  # maximum 2 change points
fit_ecp5 = ecp::ks.cp3o_delta(df_ecp, K = 2)  # maximum 2 change points

# Show the change point estimates
str(list(
  e.cp3o = fit_ecp1$estimates,
  e.cp3o_delta = fit_ecp2$estimates,
  e.divisive = fit_ecp3$estimates,
  ks.cp30 = fit_ecp4$estimates,
  ks.cp3o_delta = fit_ecp5$estimates
))
```


# TSMCP
Short for "Time-Series Multiple Change Point". The output is a single number (!). For the problem at hand, changing `method` makes no difference. For many other `c` (`c = 0.3`, `c = 4`), it fails to find any change points at all. There is also `TSMCP::cpvnts()` to model AR(N), but I have failed to make it find any change points in the present data set.

It finds the change point at `x = 30`, but not the second change point at `x = 70`.

```{r}
TSMCP::tsmcplm(df$y, X = NULL, method = "adapt", c = 1)
```




# robts::changerob
`robts` is about robust time-series regression. It is not on CRAN, so it has to be installed using `install.packages("robts", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`. I fail to install the dependencies, and development of the package seems to have stopped around 2014. It won't be covered further here.



# Packages doing only one change point

 * `strucchange::Fstats`: Returns the estimated change point (one number), and nothing else. `strucchange::Fstats(y ~ 1, data = df)` find the change point at 30 in the present data.
 * `SiZer::piecewise.linear`: Returns a change point and parameter estimates, optionally with an interval. Call like `piecewise.linear(df$x, df$y, CI = TRUE)`. Only joined slopes are supported which makes it misestimate the change point in the present data 39 [36.5, 47], but it is consistent with `segmented` which uses a similar model.
 * `easyreg::bl`.
 * `lm.br::lm.br`. Choose between line-line, line-plateau, or plateau-line. Yields confidence intervals. All of these are non-suitable for the present plateau-only model. `lm.br` stands out with the following features: (1) it can take multiple predictors, and it uniquely only models change point over just one of them, keeping the others constant. In comparison, `segmented` models changes in everything, as far as I understand it. (2) It can take known variance. (3) It can take data weights.


# Packages doing only fixed change points
As explained in [the article on mcp formulas](../articles/formulas.htm), fixed change points can be implemented in almost all regression functions. You simply have an indicator variable saying whether there has been as shift at the corresponding x-value and use it like `lm(y ~ 1 + x * I(x > 30), data = df)`. Or if you don't want a carry-over effect from the first segment, do `lm(y ~ 1 * I(x < 30) + x * I(x >= 30), data = df)`. This will work for most regression packages in R, including `survival` and `lme4`.

Some packages include this in a way where you don't have to code your indicators yourself, including:

* `scan::plm` and `scan::hplm`. To get started here, make sure to transform your data to a `scan::scdf` object.


# Others
I have yet to test these: 
 
 * `TSIS` and `segmenTier` may be coerced to do change point analysis, though it is mean for much more complicated switch point models in gene expression analysis. It's primary interface is a Shiny App.
 * `plrs::plrs`. Piecewise Linear Regression, targeted at DNA and gene expression. May also be coerced into simpler problems.
 * Packages that went under my radar initially: `ChangepointTesting`, `changepoint.mv`, `changepointsHD`, `changepointsVar`, `InspectChangepoint`, `breakpoint`, `segmentr`, `Segmentor3IsBack`, `trendsegmentR`, `BayesPiecewiseICAR`, `BayesPieceHazSelect`

You will see that the two change-points are correctly estimated.

Please see below for some other packages and non-packaged code:

These and some other latest packages are reviewed e.g. in http://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/wbs2/wbs2sdll.pdf.

Finally, if I may comment on one of the packages listed in your blog post: “wbsts” segments the autocovariance structure of a time series (not its mean!) so is unsuitable for your running example and should not be used on it.
