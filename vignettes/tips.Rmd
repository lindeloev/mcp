# Convergence
A common problem when using MCMC is lacking convergence between chains. This will show up as large `rhat` values (> 1.1 is a common criterion) and non-converging lines in `plot_pars(fit)`.

* The first thing to try is always to make the model warm up longer to see if it reaches convergence later: `mcp(fit, data, adapt = 10000)`.

* It can be a sign of a deeper non-identifiability in the model. This will show up as strong correlations in the joint distribution of any pair of implicated parameters: `plot_pars(fit, pars = c("int_1", "int_2), type = "hex")`. This may give you ideas how to change the model.

* You can set the initial values for the JAGS sampler using, e.g., `mcp(..., inits = list(cp_1 = 20, int_2 = -20, etc.))`. This will be passed to `jags.fit` and you can see more documentation there.


# Speed
A lot of data and complicated models will slow down fitting.

* Run the chains in parallel using, e.g., `mcp(..., chains=4, cores=4)`. The only reason this is not enabled by default is because parallel sampling fails on some systems. Turn it on for the whole session using `options(mc.cores = 3)` which will override `cores` (which defaults to 1).

* More data usually means better identifiability and faster convergence. Lower the adaption period period using, e.g., `mcp(..., adapt = 300)`. This is also sometimes called "burnin".



# Errors or won't run
Most of these problems should stem from inappropriate priors and such problems may be exacerbated by fragile link functions (e.g., `binomial(link = "identity")`. The article on [priors in mcp](https://lindeloev.github.io/mcp/articles/priors.html) may be helpful, but in particular:

 * Errors on "directed cycle" usually stems from using parameters in priors. For example, if you set `prior = list(int_1 = "dnorm(int_2, 1)"", int_2 = "dnorm(int_1, 1)")` this is an infinite regress.

 * Errors on "incompatible with parent nodes" usually stem from impossible values. For example, if you set `prior = list(sigma = "dnorm(0, 1)"")`, this allows for a negative standard deviation, which is impossible. Think about changing the prior distributions and perhaps truncate them using `T(lower, upper)`.


If you encounter these or other problems, don't hesitate to [raise a Github Issue](https://github.com/lindeloev/mcp/issues), asking for help or filing a bug report.
