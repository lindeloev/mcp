# Structure of the reference page
reference:
  - title: Using mcp
    desc: Functions for everyday use of mcp.
    contents:
      - mcp
      - plot.mcpfit
      - plot_pars
      - summary.mcpfit
      - ranef
      - fixef
      - loo
      - waic
      - hypothesis

  - title: Axillary functions
    desc: These are used internally by mcp, but are exposed here since they may be useful for other purposes. Most other useful internal functions deliver the result already in `mcp(segments, sample = FALSE)`, so `mcp()` will be their API.
    contents:
      - sd_to_prec
      - logit
      - ilogit

  - title: Families
    desc: Distributional families that are not available in base R.
    contents:
      - bernoulli

  - title: Simulated datasets
    desc: These datasets were simulated with mcp. There are lnks to the simulation scripts in the documentation for each of them. The simulation values will also show up if you fit a model to one of these dataset and call `summary(fit)`. Analyses of most of these are demonstrated on the [front page](https://lindeloev.github.io/mcp).
