\title{Get a list of x-coordinates to evaluate fit$simulate at}
\usage{
get_eval_at(fit, facet_by)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An mcpfit object.}

\item{facet_by}{String. Name of a varying group.}
}
\value{
A vector of x-values to evaluate at.
}
\description{
Solves two problems: if setting the number of points too high, the
function becomes slow. If setting it too low, the posterior at large intercept-
changes at change points look discrete, because they are evaluated at very
few x in that interval.
}
\details{
This function makes a vector of x-values with large spacing in general,
but finer resolution at change points.
