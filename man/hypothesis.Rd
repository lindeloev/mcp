\usage{
hypothesis(fit, hypotheses, width = 0.95, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An \code{\link{mcpfit}} object.}

\item{hypotheses}{String representation of a logical test involving model parameters.
Takes R code that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE in a vectorized way.

Directional hypotheses are specified using <, >, <=, or >=. \code{hypothesis}
returns the posterior probability and odds in favor of the stated hypothesis.
The odds can be interpreted as a Bayes Factor. For example:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cp_1 > 30"}:  the first change point is above 30.
\item \code{"Intercept_1 > Intercept_2"}: the intercept is greater in segment 1 than 2.
\item \code{"x_2 - x_1 <= 3"}: the difference between slope 1 and 2 is less
than or equal to 3.
\item \code{"Intercept_1 > -2 & Intercept_1 < 2"}: Intercept_1 is between -2 and 2 (an interval hypothesis). This can be useful as a Region Of Practical Equivalence test (ROPE).
\item \code{"cp_1^2 < 30 | (log(x_1) + log(x_2)) > 5"}: be creative.
\item \code{"`cp_1_id[1]` > `cp_1_id[2]`"}: id1 is greater than id2, as estimated
through the varying-by-"id" change point in segment 1. Note that \code{``}
required for varying effects.
}

Hypotheses can also test equality using the equal sign (=). This runs a
Savage-Dickey test, i.e., the proportion by which the probability density
has increased from the prior to the posterior at a given value. Therefore,
it requires \code{mcp(sample = "both")}. There are two requirements:
First, there can only be one equal sign, so don't use and (&) or or (|).
Second, the point to test has to be on the right, and the variables on the left.
\itemize{
\item \code{"cp_1 = 30"}: is the first change point at 30? Or to be more precise:
by what factor has the credence in cp_1 = 30 risen/fallen when
conditioning on the data, relative to the prior credence?
\item \code{"Intercept_1 + Intercept_2 = 0"}: Is the sum of two intercepts zero?
\item \code{"`cp_1_id[John]`/`cp_1_id[Erin]` = 2"}: is the varying change
point for John (which is relative to `cp_1``) double that of Erin?
}}

\item{width}{Float. The width of the highest posterior density interval
(between 0 and 1).}

\item{digits}{a non-null value for digits specifies the minimum number of
significant digits to be printed in values. The default, NULL, uses
getOption("digits"). (For the interpretation for complex numbers see signif.)
Non-integer values will be rounded down, and only values greater than or
equal to 1 and no greater than 22 are accepted.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with a row per hypothesis and the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{hypothesis} is the hypothesis; often re-arranged to test against zero.
\item \code{mean} is the posterior mean of the left-hand side of the hypothesis.
\item \code{lower} is the lower bound of the (two-sided) highest-density interval of width \code{width}.
\item \code{upper} is the upper bound of ditto.
\item \code{p} Posterior probability.
For "=" (Savage-Dickey), it is the BF converted to p.
For directional hypotheses, it is the proportion of samples that returns TRUE.
\item \code{BF} Bayes Factor in favor  of the hypothesis.
For "=" it is the Savage-Dickey density ratio.
For directional hypotheses, it is p converted to odds.
}
}
\description{
Returns posterior probabilities and Bayes Factors for flexible hypotheses involving
model parameters. The documentation for the argument \code{hypotheses} below
shows examples of how to specify hypotheses, and \href{https://lindeloev.github.io/mcp/articles/comparison.html}{read worked examples on the mcp website}.
For directional hypotheses, \verb{hypothesis`` executes the hypothesis string in a }tidybayes`` environment and summerises the proportion of samples where
the expression evaluates to TRUE. For equals-hypothesis, a Savage-Dickey
ratio is computed. Savage-Dickey requires a prior too, so remember
\code{mcp(..., sample = "both")}. This function is heavily inspired by the
`hypothesis` function from the `brms` package.
